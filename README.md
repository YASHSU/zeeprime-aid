**I'm excited to create a Solana emergency fundraising application that focuses on speed and simplicity. This reminds me of beautifully designed platforms like Cash App or Venmo, but optimized for urgent fundraising with the speed of Solana blockchain.**

**For this initial version, I'll implement:**

A modern, clean interface with smooth animations
Campaign creation functionality
Donation flow (simulated for now)
Campaign browsing and discovery
Emergency-focused UI with clear crisis categories

**For the visual design, I'll use:**

Colors: A palette with purples and teals, conveying trust and urgency
Animations: Subtle loading states and micro-interactions
Typography: Clean, legible fonts for urgent information
Layout: Mobile-responsive design with prominent CTAs

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
